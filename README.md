# Hypermedia-project
This is a project I made as an assignment which consists on developing my Curriculum Vitae using HTML, and CSS. I learned lots of new things doing it!

PROJECT ANALYSIS

- Target user profile:
  The final user will be front end job recruiters who are looking for someone to hire. As a candidate, I decided to showcase in my CV some of the most relevant             information, making it a bit interactive and visual so the recruiter doesn't get bored. They are expected to find information about who I am, all together with
  the skills and studies I have. There's no job experience in it as I haven't worked for any corporation yet.
  
- Information architecture:
  In my case I divided the CV in two pages. The landing page (Inici) which explains briefly who I am and a picture of me. It also has a card where you can put your 
  info to get in touch with me. The other page (Sobre mi) wraps all the information related to my skills and knowledge. Lastly, I have a third page (Contacte) with a       contact form in case you wanted to schedule a meet, ask me for details/doubts, etc.
  
- Visual design:
  For this Hypermedia Project I chose the black and white colors beause I felt like they would make the page look professional. But with the fonts I broke a bit the       initial concept and went a bit more contemporary using a custom font named 'Druk wide'.
